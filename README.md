# CHORD Variant Service

Proposed quality control pipeline:

* Standardize chromosome names (TODO: Only for humans? Maybe just remove `chr`)
* Verify positions are positive
* Investigate other error conditions for pytabix and check them in QC

The workflows exposed by this service currently depend on:

* HTSlib
